                        Although the P1™ is one of the most technically complex cars ever created, the systems all work together to deliver both performance and driver reward.<br><br>
                        
                        In terms of the technology it carries, it’s fair to say the P1™ is closer to the complexity of an aircraft than a conventional car. As such, it’s a showcase for the knowledge and passion of the engineering team that created it. But there are no gimmicks or pointless features – everything is focused on putting the driver at the heart of the dynamic experience.<br><br>
                        
                        The IPAS electrical assistance system is one of the most powerful hybrid powertrains ever fitted to a car, and has been designed to take on the gruelling challenge of sustained track use. Active aerodynamics mean the P1™ can maximise downforce and reduce drag, and the RCC (RaceActive Chassis Control) system gives the chassis unprecedented adjustability.

            <h3>‘IT’S AS THOUGH WE STUCK A TUBE INSIDE AND SUCKED ALL THE AIR OUT – A DRAMATIC, HONEST SHAPE, BUT ALSO A VERY BEAUTIFUL ONE’</h3>
            <div class="din">
                <p>McLaren Design Director, Frank Stephenson explains some of the inspiration for the functional yet beautiful design of the P1<sup>TM</sup><br><br>
                    ‘The engineering priority was always unmatched aerodynamic performance. My role as a designer was to make it look dramatic and beautiful. I wanted it to look like a purposeful racer with that low body, long rear deck and open-mesh rear styling to put the mechanicals on view and help cooling. Plus there’s the most aggressive rear diffuser ever seen on a road car. Like everything on the McLaren P1™, it’s there for a good reason.<br><br>
                    
                    ‘I wanted to take out as much visual weight as possible, to have a car that was really lean; a car with absolutely no fat between the mechanicals and the skin. It’s as though we stuck a tube inside and sucked all the air out – a dramatic, honest shape but also a very beautiful one. It was all part of the engineering and design approach to fanatically take out weight.
                    <br><br>
                    ‘Visibility is vital for a car like this, which is why we’ve pushed to giving it more of a canopy, to have glass all around you – it’s like a cockpit and that’s deliberate.’</p>
